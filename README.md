The Department’s goal for the transition to managed care is to improve the health of North Carolinians through an integrated and well-coordinated system of care that addresses both medical and nonmedical drivers of health. In a significant change from today’s structure, both Standard Plans and BH I/DD Tailored Plans will be fully integrated managed care plans with a benefits package that spans both physical and behavioral health services, as well as long-term services and supports (LTSS) and pharmacy benefits. Your team is considering an alternative caching product for your product to better serve these new data requirements. Compare three popular caching products and suggest the best option following an objective criterion.
